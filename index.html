    Hi, My name is <strong>Moez Bouhlel</strong> and I'm a
    <strong>software engineer</strong> at
    <a href="https://tik-services.com/"><strong>TIK</strong></a
    >. My main area of expertise is <strong>back-end engineering</strong> and
    <strong>web services development</strong>, particularly using Django, in
    addition to Python/FastAPI and Golang/Gin for
    <strong>developing microservices</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I'm a software engineer and <strong>business owner</strong> at
    <a href="https://tik-services.com/"><strong>TIK</strong></a
    >, an IT consulting agency, where I led a team of highly skilled software
    engineers undertaking projects for dozens of clients across a variety of
    industry segments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior to TIK, I worked as a freelance software developer, I made a couple of
    contributions to OSS projects, and I conducted a few workshops and training
    sessions for students and teachers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most things that interest me are cloud-native computing, and software
    design and architecture.
    <!--, and programming languages design and implementation.-->
    I absolutely love to research, design, and build distributed systems.
  </p>
