    Hi, My name is <strong>Moez Bouhlel</strong> and I'm a
    <strong>software development engineer</strong> at
    <a href="https://tik-services.com/"><strong>TIK</strong></a
    > with 5+ years of experience. My main area of expertise is <strong>back-end engineering</strong> and
      <strong>web services development</strong>, particularly using <strong>Python</strong> / Django / FastAPI and <strong>Golang</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I'm a senior software engineer and <strong>business owner</strong> at
    <a href="https://tik-services.com/"><strong>TIK</strong></a
    >, an IT consulting agency, where I led a team of highly skilled software
    engineers undertaking projects for dozens of startups and midsize businesses across a variety of
    industry segments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior to TIK, I worked as a freelance software developer, I made a couple of
    contributions to OSS projects, and I conducted a few workshops and training
    sessions for teachers and professionals.
  </p>
  <p>
    The things that interest me most are distributed computing, autonomous robotic systems, and software design and architecture.
    I absolutely love to research, design, and build scalable and resilient system software, middleware, and backends using modern languages like Python, Golang, Rust, and Scala.
  </p>
