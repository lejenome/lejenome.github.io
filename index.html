    Hi, My name is <strong>Moez Bouhlel</strong> and I'm a
    <strong>lead software engineer</strong>. My main area of expertise is <strong>back-end and middlewares engineering</strong> and
      <strong>web services development</strong>, particularly using <strong>Python</strong> / Django / FastAPI and <strong>Golang</strong>.
    I have a proven track record in <strong>designing</strong> and building scalable and efficient <strong>system backends, middlewares, and microservices</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously, I was a principal software engineer and co-founder at
    <a href="https://tik-services.com/"><strong>TIK</strong></a
    >, an IT consulting agency, where I led a team of highly skilled software
    engineers undertaking projects for dozens of startups and midsize businesses across a variety of
    industry segments.

    Prior to TIK, I worked as a freelance software developer, I made a couple of
    contributions to OSS projects, and I conducted a few workshops and trainings for teachers and professionals.

    My main interests include <strong>distributed computing</strong>, <strong>performance optimization</strong>, autonomous robotic systems, and <strong>software design and architecture</strong>.
